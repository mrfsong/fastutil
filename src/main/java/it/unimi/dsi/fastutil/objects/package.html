    <p>Provides type-specific classes for object elements or keys.

    <p>Whenever possible, {@code fastutil} provides both typical
    collections, which compare objects using {@code equals()}, and
    <em>reference-based</em> collections, which use equality
    ({@code ==}). See the related comments in the overview.

    <p>Of course, reference-based sorted sets and maps make no
sense, and are not generated.
